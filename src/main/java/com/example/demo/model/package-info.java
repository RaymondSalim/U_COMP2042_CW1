/**
 * This package contains the core model classes representing
 * the game's logical components and behavior.
 *
 * <p>Classes in this package include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Level classes (e.g., {@link com.example.demo.model.LevelOne}, {@link com.example.demo.model.LevelTwo}) that define specific game levels.</li>
 *   <li>The {@link com.example.demo.model.Player} class that manages player stats such as health and kill count.</li>
 *   <li>The {@link com.example.demo.model.base.LevelParent} abstract class, which provides a framework for implementing game levels.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>These classes are responsible for handling game logic, player interactions,
 * and enemy behaviors.
